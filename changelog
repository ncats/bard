              Added filter support to /experiments/{eid}/exptdata. As a result you can use Solr filter query syntax to filter experiment results based on outcome
              and result type. Ordering of results can also be specified via fq(order:asc) or fq(order:desc) filter queries
05/10/13      Added /biology/{bid} resource that supports GET and POST. For the latter, use the form parameter 'bids' to specify a command separated list of 
              biology identifiers. Both versions of the resource return a list of biology entities

	      Added /cap/dictionary/roots to identify root elements (ie elements with no parents)
