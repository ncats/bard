10/15/12 Allow a client to POST a request for expt data given SID and Expt ID lists. 
	 Only return data for which the SID/EID combo actually has data. See 
	 https://github.com/ncatsdpiprobedev/bard/wiki/REST-Query-API#wiki-substances
10/22/12 Removed SID list and annotation (key/value) lists from Compound JSON to improve query times
10/24/12 Support filtering of CID/SID lists for an experiment by whether they are active or not
11/1/12  Updated Compound JSON to include counts of assays tested in and active in
11/14/12 Updated to include compound_class in the /compound response and compound search responses
11/14/12 Can now search based on compound class, full-text or via query field. E.g. fq(compound_class:Patent Compound). 
	 Faceting on compound_class is also supported
11/15/12 Compound search results return concise form if expand=false, but if expand=true returns the usual compound JSON
	 representation. Same for assays and projects
11/15/12 Trimmed default (expand=false) assay JSON 
11/15/12 Implemented /substances to allow paging through the entire substances collection. Also supported filtering
	 usig source_name, dep_regid or substance_url
11/16/12 Instead of publications we now use the term documents in the assays resource JSON. In addition /assays/{id}/publications
	 is now /assays/{id}/documents

v8 released

11/19/12 Take into account skip/top when sending back expanded search results for assay, compound, project	
11/19/12 Updated assay serch rsults to includes the field names in which a match is found. We also include the value of the matching field
	        for each matched document. Located in the metaData field and keyed by assay id. Employs Solr debug mode, slight loss in perf	
11/20/12 Compound summary includes experiment data elements directly (ignores expand argument). Drops the experiment fields
11/20/12 Assay search results now include the match score provided by Solr. Located within the meta data field, keyed by assay id

v9 released	

v12 released

01/22/2012    Updated /assay resource to expose a field for minimum annotations
	      Updated assay retrieval methods to extract minimum annotations
    	      Created a helper class for annotation manipulation
	      Removed kegg annotation fields from /assays resource, moved to /assays/{aid}/annotations resource
	      Removed kegg annotation fields from /projects resource, moved to /projects/{aid}/annotations resource
01/24/2012    Updated text search code so that numeric fields in a filter query do not get quoted
01/25/2012    Fixed expt data queries to ignore unused JSON blob fields

v13 released

01/28/2012    Added CAP project id to /projects/{id} JSON
	      Parametrized Solr search classes to use core names as defined in web.xml
              Fixed quoting of numeric filters in Solr queries in general manner
01/30/2012    Ensure that we use the proper assay identifier for assay min annos
              Remove the check for old annos when getting project annotations
02/04/2013    Updated experiment data entity to include fields for associated (CAP & BARD) assay and project ids
	      /compounds/probeid/{probeid} response is updated to include the bardProjectId field
02/07/2013    Added search resource for experiments (/search/experiments)
	      Added the /projects/etag/{etag} subresource
02/08/2013    Updated GO annotations to only include direct annotations (implied=0) in JSON output (thouhg both direct and 
              implied annotations are still indexed)
	      Added /projects/{pid}/steps subresource to get project steps for a project@
02/15/2013    Assay short name is now exposed in /assay response

v14 released

02/19/13      Updated JSON for /compounds/probeid/... to use bardProjectId
	      Added cap project id to probeid JSON response
	      Implemented filter=ARG for /exptdata subresources (/compound/{cid}/exptdata, /substance/{sid}/exptdata, /experiment/{eid}/exptdata)
	      where ARG = active|inactive to return active or inactive results repsectively
02/21/13      Added count of active cmpds to expt resource
02/22/13      Removed aid field from assay JSON
