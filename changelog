10/15/12 Allow a client to POST a request for expt data given SID and Expt ID lists. 
	 Only return data for which the SID/EID combo actually has data. See 
	 https://github.com/ncatsdpiprobedev/bard/wiki/REST-Query-API#wiki-substances
10/22/12 Removed SID list and annotation (key/value) lists from Compound JSON to improve query times
10/24/12 Support filtering of CID/SID lists for an experiment by whether they are active or not
11/1/12  Updated Compound JSON to include counts of assays tested in and active in
11/14/12 Updated to include compound_class in the /compound response and compound search responses
11/14/12 Can now search based on compound class, full-text or via query field. E.g. fq(compound_class:Patent Compound). 
	 Faceting on compound_class is also supported
11/15/12 Compound search results return concise form if expand=false, but if expand=true returns the usual compound JSON
	 representation. Same for assays and projects
11/15/12 Trimmed default (expand=false) assay JSON 
11/15/12 Implemented /substances to allow paging through the entire substances collection. Also supported filtering
	 usig source_name, dep_regid or substance_url
11/16/12 Instead of publications we now use the term documents in the assays resource JSON. In addition /assays/{id}/publications
	 is now /assays/{id}/documents
